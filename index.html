<h1>Let's Eat: Seattle Washington!</h1>
<p> </p>

<h2>Top Pot Doughnuts - Seattle WA</h2>
<p>A great place to treat yourself or to catch up with friends. I've been here countless of times and this truley is a North Seattle treasure. 
  From raspberry old fashion donuts to salted caramel ice cream, it's a gaurentee that you will leave happy & satisfied! 
  Plus, the workers are super friendly and overall, there is a super welcoming environment. 
  There are small tables in the back of the shop & I've  come here to do homework many times before.  
  My only complaint would be the shop is fairly small. An easy 8.5/10  </p>

<h2>Din Tai Fung - Seattle WA </h2>
<p>This is some other text.</p>

  <h2>Lotus Thai Cuisine - Seattle WA</h2>
<p>A great place to grab a filling lunch or dinner. 
  I usually order a pad thai or pad see ew with two stars but I have also tried the fried rice and thai iced tea. 
  I highly recommend all of them! The location i go to located at 2724 E Cherry St. 
  The restuarant itself is fairly small so some people prefer to order to-go. 
  The servers take a little while to get to your table but once your order is taken, the food should arive shortly.
  The pricing is around $12 per main dish but the servings are very big & will easily fill you up. 
  I have been here several times before & I always leave satisfied. A solid 9/10!</p>

<h1> Let's Eat: Vancouver Canada!</h1>
<h2>
   Tim Hortons
</h2>
<p> Ok, you've probably heard of Tim HOrtons, regardless of if you're a Canadian or not. 
  This chain fast food restuarant is currently only avaliable in Canada so I HIGHLY recommend stopping by one if your up north. 
  There is most likely gonna be a line but after you order, the food will come in no time. 
  I usally order a wrap or a sandwich but one of my favorite items on the menu is the cinnamon rolls. 
  They're super tasty! In addition, there are always tables and restrooms. My only complaint would be that it's always really loud. 
  But, without a doubt, 9/10!
