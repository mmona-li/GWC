  </head> <h2>Welcome to my website! Here I will talk about some restuarants & food hubs that I've been to. 
    Regardless of the food quality, all these reviews are 100% honest. So whether you're here to find new places to eat, 
    or simply to look at some food pictures- I hope you enjoy :)


<h2>Lotus Thai Cuisine - Seattle WA</h2>
<p> A great place to grab a filling lunch or dinner. 
  I usually order a pad thai or pad see ew with two stars but I have also tried the fried rice and thai iced tea. 
  I highly recommend all of them! The location i go to located at 2724 E Cherry St. 
  The restuarant itself is fairly small so some people prefer to order to-go. 
  The servers take a little while to get to your table but once your order is taken, the food should arive shortly.
  The pricing is around $12 per main dish but the servings are very big & will easily fill you up. 
  I have been here several times before & I always leave satisfied. A solid 9/10
